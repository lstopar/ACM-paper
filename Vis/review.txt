==================================
USE CASES:
1.1) use cases are not clear
- who are the users, what is their domain - explain the domain need, situation, problem and why the system is useful. For which criteria? - Figure this out and design an experiment!
- what are their tasks, problems and needs
- How much knowledge and expertise would be necessary to gain benefit from the system as it is currently presented?
1.2) Why is the visualization of multivariate time series challenging? What are the real problems within the given examples

==================================
EVALUATION
2.1) system assessment is weak
2.2) No clear empirical study
2.3) On page 2 what does "Intuitively" mean? There is no study to assess the intuitiveness of the system.
2.4) Evaluation is too high level and subjective.
2.5) needs a more quantitative way to evaluate the model
- for example comparing its accuracy with a baseline Markov model
2.6) no feedback from domain experts

==================================
WRITING
3.1) the writing should be improved
- not convinced by the story of the paper
3.2) has too much math for a reader from a visualization community (might be more suitable for a machine learning conference)
3.3) lack of discussion of the multivariate part
- I have not seen any discussion of how the system supports multivariate visualization and how many variables it could support
3.4) the writing of some parts is not structured - especially the motivation part and the related work part
3.5) lack of critical comments based on existing works, why do we need the 6-th paragraph (vis in data mining)
3.6) Change the title of section 9 from "Discussion" to "Conclusion and Future Work"
3.7) There are several mistakes and redundant information in the reference lists, such as [1], [5], [7], [9], [14], [28], etc.
3.8) Some English errors:
   p.1. This is the main three panel user interface of the system. (?)
   p.1. â€¦enables us to interpret various patters (?) in the data.
   p.2. Overall, this system gives the user (users) a hierarchical view of
   the dynamics as well as allow (allows) for analysis of the system.
   p.4. This parameter also effects (affacts) the initial construction time,
   meaning for large datasets we may want to limit the number of states.
3.9) The paper falls somewhere between a technique (using interactive hierarchical Markov models for exploring multivariate timeseries) and a system which implements that technique along with a low of supporting interactinos
3.10) A little too much time spent on on the theoretical underpinnings of the framework and too little detail on the effectiveness
- how appropriate were the generated labels
- how the decision tree and rule extraction integrated wtih the generated models
- how well users could navigate the model to arrive at insights
3.11)
If this is a technique paper:
- How does this technique compare to other (related) techniques?
If it is a system paper
- should be evaluated in real practice and to see which aspects were effective and which not

==================================
COMMUNITY
4.1) The system seems to be more focused on generating (and visualizing) a Markov model at different scales than visualizing the data
4.2) The paper should be sent to a different community.
4.3) The paper needs a significant restructure on the system's visualization functions to be of intereset to InfoVis
4.4) The paper reads a bit dry to a visualization audience.

==================================
CONTRIBUTIONS
5.1) Should revise the types of contributions we are providing.
- Is it a visualization tool? Machine learning algorithm? If it's a visualization tool, what does it visualize?
5.2) The visualization does not seem very novel, it is a combination of existing techniques.

==================================
IDEAS
6.1) The model itself could be a contribution.
6.2) Mainly used for exploring the dataset. Like to see more discussion on the feedback from the visualization to hte backend model. For example when the users sees a state with no meaning, they might want to modify the states, which can be a prior condition for rebuilding the model - the machine and the user come up with a better solution.
