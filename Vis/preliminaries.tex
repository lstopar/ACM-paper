\label{sec:preliminaries}
Our framework is aimed at visualizing multivariate time-series. Here we introduce the tools required in our framework. We assume as input we are given samples of $d$ signals, which we interpret as one multi-dimensional signal:
$$f: x(t)\mapsto \mathbb{R}^d$$
For simplicity, we assume that the signals are continuous and real-valued as well as uniformly sampled. This means that all signals are sampled simultaneously and at constant intervals. These assumptions can be relaxed in practice, with a preprocessing resampling step.  Each sample then consists of a vector of samples from all input signals at time $t$. 

Assuming we have enough independent signals, we can always use a time-delay embedding to raise the dimension of our signal. 

Further, we assume that the image of $f$ defines a compact subset of Euclidean space. For our input we assume a PL-reconstruction based on time-adjacent samples.
