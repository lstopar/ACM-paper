%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
	This paper presents a novel multi-scale methodology for modeling, visualization and summarization of a collection
	of continuously time-varying data streams. The proposed methodology represents such a collection in qualitative 
	manner using a novel hierarchical framework by partitioning and aggregating the data streams using unsupervised data mining
	methods and constructing a Markovian transition model, capturing the dynamics of the data. The resulting model
	provides a visual summary and allows users to explore the data on several scales.  We validate our methodology on
	three real-world datasets.

	On the move: yearly travels of a European researcher. A multi-scale summary of GPS coordinates collected over the course of four years using a smartphone. Our system summarizes the dataset in a qualitative manner using states and transitions and models them in a hierarchical manner, allowing users to traverse the hierarchy using the zoom function. From the visual summary we were able to identify the typical locations the person visited, including the USA, Germany, China, Italy and Slovenia.
	This is the main three panel user interface of the system.  The central panel shows the main visualization of the dynamics through a Markov chain model. The side and bottom panels provide additional information on the state which has been selected in the center panel. Here, the selected state is NY, corresponding to New York City. This can be inferred using the average geocoordinates in the right panel. In the bottom panel we see a timeline of when the system was in that state.  We see several distinct short trips to NY, with one longer stay shown in the center.
%	Our interface has several different views illustrating different aspects of the data.
