StreamStory is implemented as a client-server application, with its front-end implemented in HTML5,
CSS3 and JavaScript. The page layout is handled by Twitter Bootstrap 3, providing 
responsiveness and scalability to most modern devices. We use Cytoscape.js
for visualization of graphs and trees, including the main visualization and D3.js for visualization of charts.
The front-end relies on technologies like Ajax and WebSockets for transparent real-time
updates.

The backend uses a hybrid implementation with its core functionality written in C++
as part of the QMiner data analytics platform \cite{qminer}, under the BSD license.
This functionality is exposed as a Node.js addon running in Googles V8 JavaScript
environment. Node.js thus acts as glue and exposes the functionality through RESTful
web services using the Express framework. User credentials \lstopar{and other information} are stored in a MySQL database.

Having the core functionality implemented in C++ provides performance benefits, especially
when dealing with larger datasets. When using StreamStory, the most time consuming step
is the model initialization. Indeed, after this initial step, everything works in real-time.
The initialization includes partitioning the dataset, aggregating states, modeling transitions,
computation of state statistics, initialization of state assistance services and laying out the generated
hierarchical graph onto a plane. Our experiments show that the most consuming of these tasks are
the initialization of state assistance services, where a decision tree and a logistic regression
model need to be trained for each state in the hierarchy. \lstopar{These tasks are however independent
for each state and can be parallelized.}

To measure the performance of the initialization procedure, we constructed several models on two datasets
of sizes 155MB (285k instances) and 500MB (\lstopar{3M} instances) respectively. A set of five attributes
was randomly chosen for each dataset and used in all the experiments. We
then constructed models with 18, 38 and 78 states respectively and measured the model initialization times,
shown in Figure \ref{fig:performance}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item we can see that the initialization depends on the dataset size and the number of states
	\item the small dataset was constructed quickly
	\item the larger dataset was constructed in acceptable time
