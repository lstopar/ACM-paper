StreamStory is implemented as part of the QMiner \cite{qminer} data analytics platform,
under the BSD license, with its core functionality written in C++ and exposed as a 
JavaScript API to the Node.js platform, acting as glue and exposes the functionality
via RESTful API.

Having the core functionality implemented in C++ provides great performance, even when
dealing with large datasets. The most time consuming part of StreamStory is building
an actual model from the raw data. This process includes clustering the data set,
modeling transitions, aggregating states, computing state statistics, computing state assistance
features (attribute highlighting, automatic naming, induction of decision trees, etc.) and
computing initial state positions with the most time consuming tasks being modeling the state
transitions and the computation of state assistance, as the system trains logistic regression
and decision tree models for each state in the hierarchy. These tasks are however independent
for each state and can be parallelized.
