SHOW THE DATA
- show file rainfall-england.csv (as raw text)
- show the file as a graph in MATLAB

CREATE THE MODEL
- open StreamStory and log in (as test@test.com)
-- click add model
-- choose file rainfall-england.csv
-- select the time attribute (explain that it always has to be present)
-- select all the other attributes
-- select Time as the "Time Attribute"
-- select "Month" as the time unit

-- show that two clustering algorithms are available
-- select KMeans with 12 states

-- show that two hierarchy builders are available
-- select "Distance Based"

-- name the model as Weather Example
-- write "Temperature and rainfall in Nottingham" in the description field

-- click Done

SHOW THE MODEL
- click on "View" [TODO popravi, da bodo stanja malo bolj skupaj]
-- a model with 2 states appears ("Rainfall High" and "Rainfall Low")
--- explain that these are the typical high level states of the system and that the arrows represent transitions
--- explain that the system automatically named the states based on the distribution of attributes
--- hover over state "Rainfall high"
---- a tooltip appears showing that the system is in the state for 6 months
---- the rule generates says that the temperature is > 9.xx

look at charts:
-- click on state "Rainfall high"
-- look at the histograms - the rainfall and temperature are high (show the green labeling on the average values)
-- look at the parallel coordinates - the rainfall and temperature are high again
-- look at the timeline
--- it seems to be periodic
--- click on "Yearly"
---- clearly the state appears in the "High temperature season"

zoom in:
-- zoom in until 4 states appear
-- click on state Rainfall highest
--- show the histograms - clearly the temperature in this state is high
--- show the timeline - click on "Yearly" - the state appears between June and September
-- Focus on state name and name the state summer
--- click "Save" - the states' label changes

follow the arrows:
-- click on state MEAN (upper)
--- the rainfall and temperature are average - this state appears in October - name it Oct

-- click on state "Rainfall LOW"
--- temperature and rainfall are on the lower end of the distribution
--- check out the timeline - the state appears from November to April

-- zoom in until 6 states appear
-- click on Rainfall low (the one after the upper MEAN)
--- temperature and rainfall are on the lower end of the distribution (but not quite the lowest) - it usually appears in November (name it Nov)

-- Continue with the arrows
--- the probabilities are more uniform now
--- click on state Rainfall LOWEST
---- parallel coordinates show low values of temperature and rainfall, so do the histograms and decision tree
---- the timeline suggests this state appears in the winter
--- click on state Rainfall (Previous month) LOW
---- the histograms and parallel coordinates suggest this state is a bit warmer
---- looking at the timeline, we can see that this state can appear anytime in the winter, but is most typical for April
---- we can also see that there is an arrow from this state to the coldest one
--- clearly winter is much more dynamic than summer

-- zoom in to 100%
--- let us observe the distribution of Temperature accross the states
--- click options and check temperature (the winter states are now red while the summer states are green)
---- the transitions in the winter states are all over the place - this confirms the hypothesis, summer is more deterministic than winter

--- uncheck temperature
--- zoom out until 6 states appear
--- click on state MEAN
---- the temperature and rainfall are higher now
---- the timeline suggests that this is May - name it May



DRUGI MODEL, KI NI IZ 0
- view model GEO Example
- 2 states appear - this is a high level model
-- clicking on the small state and viewing the coordinates we can see that this is roughly China
- zoom in until 7 states appear
-- click on state MEAN and view the coordinates - this is roughly the central EU
-- click on the states on the left
--- there we can find New York and San Francisco
-- click on the state on the right - this is Sweden

-- zoom in to 100%
--- not we have a low of states around Slovenia and a low of states around New York
--- it is hard to read, clearly this is not the scale we want
-- go back to 7 states - this is the scale we want
