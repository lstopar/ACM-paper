%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Figures should be in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour 
%% shifting may occur during the printing process.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1

%% for proper handling of the times font family.

\section{Trying the System}
Since the StreamStory system is a tool for exploring data, we encourage readers to interact directly with the four pre-prepared models presented in the paper: Weather, GPS trace, Traffic and Synthetic (simulated motor).
%
To access the system,  the reader should visit \url{http://streamstory.ijs.si}. 
When opening the site, users will  be presented with a landing page. Click the button ``Go to Dashboard."
On the login page, the reader can use the following credentials to access an account with the described models:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] email: test@demo.com
\item[] password: 11111111
\end{itemize}
To interact with each of the models, the reader should click ``View" button for the corresponding data set. 
%
The user may also upload their own data as a CSV file. The reader should be aware that the system expects the columns of the CSV file to be named in the first line of the file and that one attribute is a numerical representation of time. This can be an integer index or UNIX time.

Unfortunately, we are unable to make the live functionality available for the public as we do not have an appropriate source of live streaming data.
