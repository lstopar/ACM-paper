\begin{enumerate}
	\item \cite{5746509} present a recursive bi-partitioning algorithm for partitioning discrete-time Markov chains. The 
	algorithm uses Kullback-Leibler divergence rate to measure the difference between the original Markov
	model and the its approximation. The authors also present a formula for aggregating states in the discrete-time
	Markov chain.
